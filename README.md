# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

A comprehensive analysis for PyBer of the driver, ride and fare statistics by type of area (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). Utilizing pandas, this analysis seeks to study the relation between total number of drivers, rides and fares across January 2019 to April 2019, grouped by the type of cities present. Comparison of these values allow us to understand where business interests are congregated. 

## Results

As can be seen in the figure above, Urban areas had the highest number of rides and drivers as well as fares with 1625 total rides, 2405 total drivers, and a total fare of $39,854,38. This constitutes for more than half the fare collected in the given timespan of this dataframe. Average fares per rides and drivers were cheapest in the Urban areas as well. 

Compared to such, rural areas had the least total number of rides, drivers and total fares and yet had the highest average fares per ride and driver,  a $34.62 // $55.49  respective to Urban area's  $24.53 // $16.57. Suburban areas set in middling grounds between the urban and rural figures.

This line data helps us better visualize the discrepancy between city types and their fares. While there seems to be a generalized trend of total fares' rise and fall over the months (an overall peak in late Feb., for example, and the steady decline that can be observed between March and April), more research is needed to make any conclusive report on how time may impact the business productivity for PyBer. 

## Summary

Urban type cities dominate total fare across the four months, while suburban the next-most and rural cities make the least total fare monthly. This trend is observable through the number of total drivers and rides as well throrughout the entirety of the four month period between January 2019 to April 2019. 

### Business Recommmendations
1. Further research may be required to determine prercisely why the average fares per ride and driver increase the further one gets from an urban area. Namely, average fare per driver nearly triples between Urban and Rural cities. Is this due to the lack of drivers, or simply the reluctance of drivers to head to rural areas? 
2. In line with no.1, it may bring the business more profit to slightly increase the fares of Urban rides and drivers.
3. Additional research may be required (an year's worth of data, etc) to better analyze the relationship between total fares / month and the time of year. Adjusting fares to better promote PyBer usage in the declining months as well as increasing the fares for when rides are most needed, may increase productivity for the business overall.
